**Describe the Bug**
A clear and concise description of what the problem is. A simple "Counters+ doesn't work" aint gonna cut it, chief!

**Attach or Link Files**
To help me solve this issue, I might need access to more then what you say or provide.

A helpful start is to attach your `latest.log` file from the `<Beat Saber>/Logs` folder. If you feel it is necessary, you can also attach the configuration file found in `<Beat Saber>/UserData/CountersPlus.json`.

**Screenshots or Video**
If applicable, add screenshots or videos to help me out. Sometimes, words ain't enough!

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.
